## Overview
 Create a rating landing page that enables Users to click on a rating from 1 to 5

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I learned how to connect the function of buttons in Javascript. I gained more understanding of how vh and rems in CSS work to make a site functional across devices. I learned how to make a list of buttons on HTML. I understood the hover and focus functions in CSS.


### Continued development

Next time I will make the Rate Again button go back to the main site. I will add more rating functions for different topics. I will store the rating in the backend and use it for data.


### Useful resources
Resource 1: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQnUopEeZgw) - TsbSankara's video. This helped me know what steps to take and how to connect things together. I would try the code on my own then watch. Then try on my own again.

Resource 2: (https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me to visualize the flex properties
